# NIKKE Spine Viewer
A simple tool that uses a modified version of [anosu's Spine Viewer](https://github.com/anosu/Spine-Viewer) to view [NIKKE](https://nikke-en.com/) Spine animations or any other compatible game that uses Spine.


### The script to download the viewer uses [NicKoehler's mediafire bulk downloader](https://github.com/NicKoehler/mediafire_bulk_downloader).

## Portable Version (old GUI):
If you don't want to install the stuff below to use the scripts you can download this portable version ready for usage.

### Buttons:

`Preview`: Open the corresponding skeleton viewer version to see the Spine animation.

`Refresh Mods List`: If you renamed, moved or deleted the mods then use this button to refresh the mods list to show the changes.

`Rename`: Renames your mods directly from the GUI. It's not necessary to use `_` in this case.

# Update 2.0 Version:

Better style on the GUI, this version works as script instead. The list of characters is updated automatically now; and I added a search bar to filter your mods list by author, character, standing, aim, cover, etc.

## Requirements to use the scripts:

  - Double-click on _install_requirements.bat_ to install the required dependencies and Python 3.13.
  - Download and install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe), and after that install the necessary libraries following [this video](https://files.catbox.moe/vqsuix.mp4).
